# About the Project

This API project and Web Project (under development - in the future, this repository will be made public) primarily aim to enable people to engage in a series of debates to share their thoughts with each other. The project structure allows people to develop their ideas and thoughts on a foundation (here `news` is designated as the codename) and share them as if they were columns in newspapers, while others can share their own ideas and thoughts in response.

# Testing
This project is being tested with the `Laravel Herd` application. Therefore, it is recommended that those who want to test the application use the `Laravel Herd` application.
